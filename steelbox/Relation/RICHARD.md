# HI RICHARD

python trainer.py --model baseline --dataset_path Sort-of-CLEVR_default_subset

model can be [baseline or rn]

dataset_path can be one of the 3 things

Total of 6 experiments. 

They should generate files that looks like 

Sort-of-CLEVR_default_subset___baseline.p

so total of 6 of those guys. If we have them we can do the plot
